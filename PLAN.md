# PLAN.md - Elrond HS Codes Project Roadmap

## üìä Current Status Analysis
**Project State**: CRITICAL - Frontend and backend completely disconnected
**Codebase Health**: 40% bloat, 60% functional but mock-based
**Priority**: Architecture decision and integration required immediately

---

## üéØ PHASE 1: IMMEDIATE CLEANUP AND ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS
**Timeline**: 1-2 Days
**Goal**: Remove bloat, choose unified architecture

### 1.1 Remove Duplicate and Unused Files
- [ ] **Delete** `AGENTERRORS.md` (error tracking file - issues resolved)
- [ ] **Delete** `plan.md` (duplicate planning file)
- [ ] **Investigate and potentially delete** `hs_embeddings_600970782048097937.pkl` (15MB file)
  - [ ] Verify if fullimpl.py actually uses this file
  - [ ] Remove if choosing hsai.py approach

### 1.2 Architecture Decision - Backend Consolidation
**DECISION REQUIRED**: Choose ONE of these approaches:

#### Option A: Full AI Implementation
- [ ] **Keep**: `fullimpl.py`
- [ ] **Delete**: `hsai.py`, `semrank.py`
- [ ] **Requirements**: sentence-transformers, sklearn, anthropic, embeddings file
- [ ] **Pros**: Real AI, production-ready
- [ ] **Cons**: Complex dependencies, slower development

#### Option B: Mock/Development Implementation
- [ ] **Keep**: `hsai.py`
- [ ] **Delete**: `fullimpl.py`, `semrank.py`, `hs_embeddings_600970782048097937.pkl`
- [ ] **Requirements**: anthropic only
- [ ] **Pros**: Fast development, simple
- [ ] **Cons**: Limited real functionality

#### Option C: Streamlit Pivot
- [ ] **Keep**: `semrank.py`
- [ ] **Delete**: `fullimpl.py`, `hsai.py`
- [ ] **Archive**: React frontend (move to separate folder)
- [ ] **Pros**: Working UI + backend integration
- [ ] **Cons**: Abandons React investment

**üö® DECISION DEADLINE**: Choose by end of Phase 1

### 1.3 Frontend UI Decision
**DECISION REQUIRED**: React Dashboard OR Streamlit Interface
- [ ] If choosing Options A or B: Keep React, remove Streamlit
- [ ] If choosing Option C: Keep Streamlit, archive React
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect chosen approach

## üîß PHASE 2: BACKEND INTEGRATION
**Timeline**: 3-5 Days
**Goal**: Connect frontend to backend with real data flow

### 2.1 Backend API Development
Based on Phase 1 decision:

#### If keeping Python backend + React frontend:
- [ ] **Create FastAPI or Flask server** in chosen Python file
- [ ] **Implement REST endpoints**:
  - [ ] `POST /api/classify` - Product classification
  - [ ] `GET /api/products` - List classified products
  - [ ] `POST /api/questions/generate` - Dynamic question generation
  - [ ] `GET /api/health` - Health check
- [ ] **Add CORS configuration** for React frontend
- [ ] **Environment configuration** for API keys and database

#### If keeping Streamlit only:
- [ ] **Enhanced Streamlit interface**
- [ ] **Session state management**
- [ ] **File upload capabilities**
- [ ] **Export functionality**

### 2.2 Frontend API Integration
If keeping React frontend:
- [ ] **Update** `/elrond-hs-codes/src/utils/claudeApi.ts`:
  - [ ] Replace `undefined` API keys with environment variables
  - [ ] Update endpoints to point to local backend
  - [ ] Add error handling for real API responses
- [ ] **Create** `/elrond-hs-codes/.env` file with configuration
- [ ] **Test** API connectivity end-to-end

### 2.3 Data Flow Integration
- [ ] **Replace mock data** in `mockData.ts` with real API calls
- [ ] **Update components** to handle real data loading states
- [ ] **Implement error boundaries** for API failures
- [ ] **Add loading spinners** and user feedback

- [ ] **Implement status helpers** for better UX feedback

### 3.3 Custom Hooks Development
- [ ] **Create** `/elrond-hs-codes/src/hooks/useProducts.ts`
- [ ] **Create** `/elrond-hs-codes/src/hooks/useClassification.ts`
- [ ] **Create** `/elrond-hs-codes/src/hooks/useQuestions.ts`
